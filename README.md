# 18AIL66-MACHINE-LEARNING-LABORATORY
The project involves implementing various machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing techniques. The algorithms covered include the FIND-S algorithm, LIST THEN ELIMINATE algorithm, Candidate-Elimination algorithm, decision tree based ID3 algorithm, Random Forest algorithm, naive Bayesian classifier, and SVM classifier.

Additionally, the project focuses on data preprocessing activities such as data cleaning, integration, and transformation. This includes tasks like identifying and deleting rows with duplicate data and identifying and deleting columns with a single value.

The project also explores the application of these algorithms and techniques on appropriate datasets. For example, the decision tree algorithm is demonstrated using an appropriate dataset to build a decision tree and classify new samples. Similarly, the Random Forest algorithm, naive Bayesian classifier, and SVM classifier are applied to suitable datasets for classification tasks.

Furthermore, the project involves constructing a Bayesian network using medical data. This network is utilized for the diagnosis of heart patients using a standard Heart Disease Dataset.

Lastly, the EM algorithm is demonstrated to cluster a set of data stored in a CSV file.

Overall, the project provides a comprehensive exploration of various machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing techniques, showcasing their implementation and demonstrating their effectiveness on different datasets.
